= Lab 6 - Publishing a Contract to Pact Broker

In this lab we'll publish the ``pact'' we generated in link:lab_04.html[Lab 4] to a running instance of Pact Broker.

NOTE: These instructions assume you've already executed the `setup_pact.sh` script mentioned in the link:student_guide.html[Student Guide] under *First Things First*.

. Change to the Pact Broker example directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/labs/pact_broker/example
----

. In case you have a stale terminal session, make sure RVM is initialized:
+
----
$ source /home/workshop/.rvm/scripts/rvm
----

. Start Pact Broker:
+
----
$ bundle exec rackup
----
+
You should see output similar to the following:
+
----
Thin web server (v1.6.3 codename Protein Powder)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on localhost:9292, CTRL+C to stop
----

. Visit http://localhost:9292.
You should see output similar to the following:

. In another terminal window, change to the following directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/labs/initial/fortune-teller/fortune-teller-ui/target/pacts
----

. Publish the pact using cURL:
+
----
$ curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:9292/pacts/provider/FortuneService/consumer/FortuneUi/version/1.0.0 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d@FortuneUi-FortuneService.json
----
+
You should see output similar to the following:
